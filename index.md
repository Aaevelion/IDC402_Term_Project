This is a video of the simulation of a galaxy with 1000 stars. All axes are in $kpc$. The stars are represented as points, and their motion is calculated using the N-body simulation method. The simulation shows how the stars move under the influence of their mutual gravitational attraction. A Ferrer's bar is also added to study it's effect on the orbits. This simulation shows the progress of the galaxy for 250 Myrs, with an integration time of 0.5 Myrs. The bar however, is not so visible over here due to over clustering (it is very faint, and noticeable only if looked at very carefully)

In this one, the integration time is 1 Myr, and rest all paramters are the same. The bar is much more visible in this case, rising and ebbing with the Galaxy's temporal evolution. Formation of bars in galaxies is widely believed to be an evolutionary phenomenon in galaxies, forming and disappearing as time progresses. The exact mechanism of formation is widely debated.
